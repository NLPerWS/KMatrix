Objects that are gravitationally bound will rotate around a common center of mass. For stellar bodies, this motion is known as peculiar velocity, and can alter the Hubble Flow. Thus, an extra term for the peculiar motion needs to be added to Hubble's law: This motion can cause confusion when looking at a solar or galactic spectrum, because the expected redshift based on the simple Hubble law will be obscured by the peculiar motion. For example, the shape and size of the Virgo Cluster has been a matter of great scientific\"\t\"Astronomical spectroscopy\"\n", "score": "1.5892413"}, {"id": "wikipedia_1277390", "title": "\"Solar time\"\n", "content": "wikipedia_1277390\t\"by a sundial. The equivalent on other planets is termed local true solar time (LTST). The length of a solar day varies through the year, and the accumulated effect produces seasonal deviations of up to 16 minutes from the mean. The effect has two main causes. First, Earth's orbit is an ellipse, not a circle, so the Earth moves faster when it is nearest the Sun (perihelion) and slower when it is farthest from the Sun (aphelion) (see Kepler's laws of planetary motion). Second, due to Earth's axial tilt (known as the \"\"obliquity of the ecliptic\"\"), the Sun's annual motion\"\t\"Solar time\"\n", "score": "1.5817201"}, {"id": "wikipedia_360702", "title": "Science\n", "content": "wikipedia_360702\t\"studied by the artists of the Renaissance. This theory utilizes only three of Aristotle's four causes: formal, material, and final. In the sixteenth century, Copernicus formulated a heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model of Ptolemy's \"\"Almagest\"\". This was based on a theorem that the orbital periods of the planets are longer as their orbs are farther from the centre of motion, which he found not to agree with Ptolemy's model.
